Backend development handles the server-side logic, database, and core functionality of web applications. It ensures smooth communication between the server and client using languages and frameworks like Node.js, Django, and Spring
Node.js is a powerful, open-source, and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 engine. It allows you to run JavaScript code outside the browser, making it ideal for building scalable server-side and networking applications.
JavaScript was mainly used for frontend development earlier. With Node.js (introduced in 2009), JavaScript became a backend language as well.
Non-blocking, event-driven architecture for high performance.
Supports the creation of REST APIs, real-time applications, and microservices.
Comes with a rich library of modules through npm (Node Package Manager).
An API (Application Programming Interface) allows applications to communicate by handling data access and responses between systems. Backend developers use APIs to connect services and improve user experience. Express.js is a popular choice for creating and managing APIs for seamless client-server interaction. Some of the APIs you should know about are:
REST
JSON
SOAP
GSON
XML-RPC
AES
